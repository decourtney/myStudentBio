            Husband and father of 4 spawns ranging from 11 to 21 - the youngest being my fellow coding nerd. My free
            time
            is
            spent
            PC (master race) gaming, tinkering with Unity3D projects (helping my son), occasionally dipping into 3D
            modeling/sculpting, and hiding from the Sun.

            My career in Cyber Security started when I joined the Marine Corps in '98. I was officially trained and
            labeled
            as
            a
            Morse Code Operator however due to the lack of morse code targets I fell into the role of digital network
            analysis.
            My
            second duty station was working at NSA facilities in Maryland where I did a deep dive into Cyber Security.
            From
            there I
            transitioned into the civilian workforce as a DoD contractor for several years in Maryland eventually making
            my
            way
            through West Virginia working for the FBI and finally landing in Florida. For the last 7 years, I've taught
            Cyber
            Security courses to new military members.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I've enjoyed my time in Cyber Security, it was a career I didn't choose. The times I did commit to
            writing
            scripts
            or attempting to create an app were fun, challenging, and extremely rewarding. So the last couple of years I
            set
            out
            to
            change my career path by first completing my B.S. in Information Technology degree (focus in software
            development)
            and
            now the Coding Bootcamp (to become more comfortable and proficient with coding).
